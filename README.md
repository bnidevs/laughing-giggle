JS Function for Expanding GMail Clippings

Use this in the browser console to get rid of those frustrating ellipses in GMail and replace it with what should actually be there: EMAIL FOOTERS!

Just copypasta the JS into the browser console, click enter, then type the function name *func()* and run it!
